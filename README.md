# Fractional-Order-Differential-Model-for-Knee-Implant-Recovery-in-Smart-Health-Infrastructures
This code simulates the healing and infection dynamics in a knee implant recovery scenario using a fractional-order model that accounts for biological memory effects. It numerically solves the system using a Caputo–Fabrizio fractional differential scheme and visualises the time-dependent behaviour of recovery, infection, and medication interactions.
Summary of the Code

This MATLAB script implements a numerical simulation of a fractional-order differential model using the Caputo–Fabrizio–Caputo (Exponential Law) operator. The model describes the recovery dynamics of a knee implant system, inspired by a biological interaction (referred to here as a Bacteria–Fungi model with plant extract and drug control).

Key Features:

Fractional-Order Framework:

Uses a fractional derivative of order α = 0.976, which captures memory and hereditary effects typical in biological recovery processes.

Model Equations:

Defines three coupled state variables:

R(t): Recovery or regenerative tissue response

I(t): Infection or inflammation component

M(t): Medication or immune modulation effect

The system of equations (f1, f2, f3) models how these components interact over time under therapeutic and biological influences.

Numerical Algorithm:

Employs a constant-step Caputo–Fabrizio–Caputo (CFC) numerical scheme to approximate the fractional derivatives.

The algorithm iteratively computes the next values of R, I, and M using a modified form of the fractional forward difference method.

Simulation Setup:

Time step: h = 0.02

Simulation period: t = 0 → 1000

Initial conditions: R(1) = 0.5, I(1) = 0.2, M(1) = 0.6.

Output:

Plots the evolution of the three compartments (R, I, M) over time to visualise the implant recovery process.

The plotted curves show how infection control, medication response, and recovery interact dynamically under fractional-order influence.
