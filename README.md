# Fractional-Order-Differential-Model-for-Knee-Implant-Recovery-in-Smart-Health-Infrastructures
This code simulates the healing and infection dynamics in a knee implant recovery scenario using a fractional-order model that accounts for biological memory effects. It numerically solves the system using a Caputoâ€“Fabrizio fractional differential scheme
